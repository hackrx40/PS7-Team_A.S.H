I had a policy of Max Life Insurance which was sold by a agent. Agent was lier because I wanted to buy a Mony back policy but he sold me share market based policy. When I got informed by a friend so I decided to surrender it and I just got only 30 percent against my invested amount.,https://www.mouthshut.com/Manoj404,1,Negative

"Im working in maxlife insurance as agent advisor from 18.3.2019, as i seen that maxlife working environment culture is good, providing international trip also, every month there is GO meet for agents they give active cena certificate when they logged policy within 10th in a month, premium leader mns doing business Rs2lacs an above, 5A monther mns logged 5 policies, 10A monther mns logged 10 policies. If a person is an advisor, agncy associate manager and agncy manager no1 will say anythng to them except boss bcz for agents they are totally comission based + incentive + bonus but for agency manager they get salary very low but as chief agncy manager salary Rs25000 but their incentive is unlimited how much their agnt got comission out of that 90 to 95% they recieve. But once u become agency development manager then ??????????because they are salaried employeed they have to recruit agents then business ?????? ???? ?? if they dnt bring due to any reason then ???? ??? ???? ????? Agnt work is best, freelancer u can also do as part time also once u become trained well.",https://www.mouthshut.com/shubhchotuss47,5,Positive

"I took Max Life Partener Plus Policy from one of the agents of Max Life Insurance ten years before.I had paid a total amount of Rupees Five Lacs.Due to few financial problems faced by me, I was enforced to surrender the policy.The response given to me was, ""You will be paid 30% of the amount that has been paid by you so far on surrendering the policy"".I was really annoyed considering the fact that the agent did not disclose while explaining about policy during initial discussion.After having paid the amount, I got bond with all terms and conditions resulting in a loss of Rupees 3.5 Lacs plus the interest accumulated on the policy.Guys, we are getting cheated from Max Life Insurance and our hard earned money is getting looted by them.",https://www.mouthshut.com/p162_261,2,Negative
