I had a policy of Max Life Insurance which was sold by a agent. Agent was lier because I wanted to buy a Mony back policy but he sold me share market based policy. When I got informed by a friend so I decided to surrender it and I just got only 30 percent against my invested amount.,https://www.mouthshut.com/Manoj404,1,Negative

"I took Max Life Partener Plus Policy from one of the agents of Max Life Insurance ten years before.I had paid a total amount of Rupees Five Lacs.Due to few financial problems faced by me, I was enforced to surrender the policy.The response given to me was, ""You will be paid 30% of the amount that has been paid by you so far on surrendering the policy"".I was really annoyed considering the fact that the agent did not disclose while explaining about policy during initial discussion.After having paid the amount, I got bond with all terms and conditions resulting in a loss of Rupees 3.5 Lacs plus the interest accumulated on the policy.Guys, we are getting cheated from Max Life Insurance and our hard earned money is getting looted by them.",https://www.mouthshut.com/p162_261,2,Negative
